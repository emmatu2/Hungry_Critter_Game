Hungry Critter is a simple game where you control an insect (Ant or Spider) to collect leaves while avoiding boundaries on a 20x20 board.
Choose between an Ant or a Spider as your critter.

Each critter moves differently:
- Ant moves 1 unit left/right and 2 units up/down.
- Spider moves 1 unit right/up and 2 units left/down.
  
The board is randomly populated with leaves.
Collect leaves while navigating the board.
If your critter hits the boundary the game ends.
